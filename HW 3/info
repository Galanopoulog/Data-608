# Overall:
# Must use 'shiny' package
# Maybe use plotly or vegalite
# Must submit 4 files: 2 'ui.R' and 2 'server.R'


# Question 1
# Compare mortality rates from particular causes across the US.
# Visualization of crude mortality rates across all states from one cause (for 2010 only).
# Visualization that allows to rank states by crude mortality for each cause of death.


# Question 2
# Are states improving mortality rates (per cause) faster/slower than national average?
# Visualization for one cause of death at a time.
# National average should be weighted average by the national population.
