                          Background:
Enterococcus = fecal indicating bacteria. Lives in the intestines of humans
and other warm-blooded animals. The counts are useful as a water
quality indicator (low abundance in sewage-free environments). 

EPA reports counts as colonies (or cells) per 100ml of water.
Standard for unacceptable water quality is:
1) A single sample value > 110 Enterococcus/100 mL or
2) Five or more samples with a weighted average > 30 Enterococcus/100 mL.


                           Question 1:
For Kayak Enthusiasts:
Create an app that recommends launch sites to users. Allows a user to pick a 
date and will give its recommendations for that particular date. Use federal 
guidelines above (may still need to make some assumptions about sites). 
Include some information explaining why a particular site is flagged as unsafe.



                            Question 2:
For Scientists:
Would like to know if thereâ€™s a relationship between amount of rain and water 
quality. App allows researchers to pick sites and compare this relationship.
