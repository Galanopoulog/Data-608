The datasets used incorporate gun violence from within and outside the United States.

1) For the global data, the Global Health Data Exchange website was used
(http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool)
This website catalogs censuses and surveys to record and analyze health-related data and vital statistics regarding a country.
The parameters used from this website will include percentages, rates and number of incidents from ages 1-94 where death from firearms 
was the result (either unintentionally, intentionally or due to self-harm) from the years of 2007 to 2016. Due to its size, this dataset
is split into 3 csv files.

2) For data regarding the United States, the Gun Violence Archive website was used
(http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/total-number-of-incidents)
This non-profit corporation collects and checks data regarding gun-related violence within the U.S. and records the location, 
the incidentâ€™s date, the number of injured and killed in addition to a link to the report with details regarding the event. This
dataset includes incidents from the year 2014 to early May of 2018.
